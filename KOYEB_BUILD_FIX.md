# ðŸ”§ Koyeb Build Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The Docker build was failing due to Husky git hooks trying to run during the production build process.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
- **Multi-stage build**: Separates build and production stages
- **Skip scripts**: Added `--ignore-scripts` flag to npm install
- **Production optimization**: Only installs production dependencies in final stage

### 2. Added .npmrc Configuration
```ini
# Skip husky installation during npm install
husky=false

# Use npm ci for faster, reliable builds
package-lock=true

# Skip optional dependencies
optional=false
```

### 3. Build Process Improvements
- **Builder stage**: Installs all dependencies and builds the app
- **Production stage**: Only copies built files and production dependencies
- **Smaller image**: Final image only contains what's needed to run

## What Changed
- âœ… **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with proper dependency handling
- âœ… **.npmrc**: Prevents husky from running during build
- âœ… **Build optimization**: Smaller production image size

## Next Steps
1. **Redeploy on Koyeb**: The build should now succeed
2. **Monitor deployment**: Check Koyeb logs for any remaining issues
3. **Test the app**: Verify the deployed app is working correctly

## Build Commands Used
```bash
# Build stage
npm ci --ignore-scripts  # Install all deps without running scripts
npm run build            # Build the Next.js app

# Production stage  
npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts  # Install only production deps
npm start               # Start the production server
```

The build should now complete successfully on Koyeb! ðŸš€
